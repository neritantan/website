        <p><strong>The Shawshank Redemption</strong>  has become a classic film - it's even <b>IMDb's </b>  top-rated movie of all time - but did you know it almost had an entirely different cast behind those legendary bars?</p>

        <p>Cinematographer <mark>Gordon Willis</mark> earned himself the nickname <b>"The Prince of Darkness," </b>  since his sets were so underlit. <b>"Paramount Pictures" </b>  executives initially thought that the footage was too dark, until persuaded otherwise by <mark>Willis and Francis Ford Coppola</mark> that it was to emphasize the shadiness of the Corleone family's dealings.</p>

         <p>It is said that all of the license plates seen on cars in the film are Illinois plates. In fact, they're not: they are actually plates for the fictional Gotham, although they resemble Illinois plates. <b> The "Gotham" plates </b> that were created by film makers were made to look like <i>Illinois plates, </i>  just in case some slipped through in background shots during filming in <mark>Chicago.</mark> </p>

            <h2 id="morbin">4. Morbius (2022)</h2>
         </a>
         
         <img src="https://tr.web.img2.acsta.net/pictures/22/03/30/15/57/0917948.jpg" alt="morbin" width="150">
         <p>By any means this is not a good movie with interesting story and well-written characters. It's hard to determine, but maybe "Morbius" won the prize for the weakest film in <i>SSU (Sony's Universe)</i> and honestly it does with ease.

            Leto is "okay" in the role of <b>Michael Morbius</b>, the problem is that the role itself is not very well written. <mark>Matt Smith</mark>  is the one who had the most fun with his role, everyone else is just there.
            
            The story is exactly what you expect to see - 90% similar to the previous two "Venom" movies, so there is no big mystery to unravel.
            
            The effects are pretty...how to say it...for the most part bad for a comicbook movie in 2022. Let's not forget that this movie was supposed to come out in 2020, initially before "No Way Home". However, I'm not sure that the people who worked on it did their job in the extra 2 years time, because...well I'll leave that to you.
            
            The main reason someone to be interested in this film is to understand how everything connects, given the easter eggs from the trailers. Well, don't expect too much, because you'll be disappointed.
            
            <b> Morbius</b> is another interesting character, who does not need a solo movie, only to be presented properly. Unfortunately, Sony again has surpassed themselves even after they squandered so much opportunities with the <b>"Venom"</b>  movies. Honestly, I don't have high hopes for neither <b>"Kraven"</b> or <b>"Madame Web"</b>. The standard is pretty low.
            
            The film is mediocre and feels like something straight from <del>2005</del> <ins>2006</ins> , with some nasty effects and overall made just to make some dollars. Pitty. Disgrace to the character.
            
            I can say that the best...or rather the <mark><b>stupidest</b></mark> they have left for the end. I mean the credit scenes will make you shake your head and laugh.
