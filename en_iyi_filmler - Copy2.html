            <span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">M</span>ore than thirty years ago the collective might of Columbia Pictures descended on Austin with one of that studio’s blue-ribbon, A-team moviemaking armies: Blythe Danner, Anthony Perkins, Beau Bridges, a hot director named Sidney Lumet, an ingenue named Susan Sarandon, and the same producer who had already made small-town Texas a bankable commodity with the adaptation of Larry McMurtry’s The Last Picture Show. The prestige project settled in at the Chariot Inn, where Danner had a permanent sign on her door—“Quiet! Mother and Baby Sleeping”—to protect the weeks-old Gwyneth Paltrow. And each day a wagon train of private Winnebagos, Cinemobiles, catering trucks, and Greyhound buses would fan out around Bastrop for the filming of yet another McMurtry novel, Leaving Cheyenne.

On a certain day, the production broke for lunch, and the movie’s proud papa, producer Steve Friedman, noticed a scruffy, long-haired hippie making his way through the food line. Friedman walked over and blocked his way. “Do you work on the movie?” he demanded.

The interloper held a plastic plate with two barbecued chicken wings on it. “Uh, no.”

“Then put the chicken back.”

The disheveled guy meekly took the chicken wings back to the catering truck. In 1974 Columbia released Lovin’ Molly, as the picture came to be called, to universal critical yawns, caused in part by its almost-three-hour running time. “If I were forced to settle on one word to describe Lovin’ Molly,” wrote McMurtry at the time, “ ‘casual’ might be the word—though ‘indifferent’ would run it an excellent race. . . . Certainly [Lumet’s] indifference to locale was so total that one is sorry he was put to the anguish of uprooting himself from home and hearth for even the few short weeks he could bring himself to stay in Texas.” Today most people have no idea that Leaving Cheyenne was ever filmed, and it is unavailable even in specialty video stores that otherwise stock the entire Lumet oeuvre.

        <p><strong>The Shawshank Redemption</strong>  has become a classic film - it's even <b>IMDb's </b>  top-rated movie of all time - but did you know it almost had an entirely different cast behind those legendary bars? Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.</p>

        <p>Cinematographer <mark>Gordon Willis</mark> earned himself the nickname <b>"The Prince of Darkness," </b>  since his sets were so underlit. <b>"Paramount Pictures" </b>  executives initially thought that the footage was too dark, until persuaded otherwise by <mark>Willis and Francis Ford Coppola</mark> that it was to emphasize the shadiness of the Corleone family's dealings. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.</p>

         <p>It is said that all of the license plates seen on cars in the film are Illinois plates. In fact, they're not: they are actually plates for the fictional Gotham, although they resemble Illinois plates. <b> The "Gotham" plates </b> that were created by film makers were made to look like <i>Illinois plates, </i>  just in case some slipped through in background shots during filming in <mark>Chicago.</mark> With the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman (Christian Bale) has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker (Heath Ledger) suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism.</p>

            <h2 id="morbin">4. Morbius (2022)</h2>
         </a>
         
         <img src="https://tr.web.img2.acsta.net/pictures/22/03/30/15/57/0917948.jpg" alt="morbin" width="150">
         <p>By any means this is not a good movie with interesting story and well-written characters. It's hard to determine, but maybe "Morbius" won the prize for the weakest film in <i>SSU (Sony's Universe)</i> and honestly it does with ease.

            Leto is "okay" in the role of <b>Michael Morbius</b>, the problem is that the role itself is not very well written. <mark>Matt Smith</mark>  is the one who had the most fun with his role, everyone else is just there.
            
            The story is exactly what you expect to see - 90% similar to the previous two "Venom" movies, so there is no big mystery to unravel.
            
            The effects are pretty...how to say it...for the most part bad for a comicbook movie in 2022. Let's not forget that this movie was supposed to come out in 2020, initially before "No Way Home". However, I'm not sure that the people who worked on it did their job in the extra 2 years time, because...well I'll leave that to you.
            
            The main reason someone to be interested in this film is to understand how everything connects, given the easter eggs from the trailers. Well, don't expect too much, because you'll be disappointed.
            
            <b> Morbius</b> is another interesting character, who does not need a solo movie, only to be presented properly. Unfortunately, Sony again has surpassed themselves even after they squandered so much opportunities with the <b>"Venom"</b>  movies. Honestly, I don't have high hopes for neither <b>"Kraven"</b> or <b>"Madame Web"</b>. The standard is pretty low.
            
            The film is mediocre and feels like something straight from <del>2005</del> <ins>2006</ins> , with some nasty effects and overall made just to make some dollars. Pitty. Disgrace to the character.
            
            I can say that the best...or rather the <mark><b>stupidest</b></mark> they have left for the end. I mean the credit scenes will make you shake your head and laugh.
